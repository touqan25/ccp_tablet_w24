                <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.<br>
                At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

Fun fact: she dropped her tail soon after she was adopted; unlike leopard geckos, crested geckos do not grow a second tail after dropping their first one. Kenma just has a little nub now where her tail used to be. We love this chubby girl just the way she is!</p>

                <p>Scruggs is my geriatric 16 year old cat. He was named after my mom's patient, from whom we adopted him in 2008. Her cat got pregnant and had a litter of kittens. Not knowing what to do with all of them, she asked my mom if she was looking for another cat. My mom took one look at the litter and picked this little guy, the runt of the litter.</p>
