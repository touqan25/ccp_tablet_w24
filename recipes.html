                <p>These cookies are a family favorite. They are soft and chewy, and the perfect amount of chocolate. They are also very easy to make!<br> My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

            <p><a href="https://inbloombakery.com/black-velvet-cupcakes/">These cupcakes</a> are incredibly rich from the use of black cocoa powder, aka the cocoa powder used for oreos. They are paired with a black cocoa American buttercream frosting and decorated with spiderwebs fashioned out of melted marshmallows. They are the perfect spooky halloween treat!</p>

                <h4>Black Velvet Cupcake Batter</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F and line a cupcake pan with cupcake liners.</li>
                        <li>In a small bowl whisk together the flour, black cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, salt and espresso powder. Then set aside.</li>
                        <li>Cream the butter and sugar together in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Then add in egg, egg yolk and vanilla and mix on medium-high speed until pale in color and smooth, about 1 minute.</li>
                        <li>Next mix in the milk and sour cream on low speed until combined. The mixture will look curdled but don't worry, it will pull together once the dry ingredients are added in.</li>
                        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and combine on low speed. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl as necessary with a rubber spatula.</li>
                        <li>Divide the batter evenly among the 12 liners, each should be about three-quarters full. Bake the cupcakes for 17-19 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Let the cupcakes cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. </li>
                    </ol>
                <h4>Buttercream</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>While the cupcakes are cooling make the frosting by adding the softened, unsalted butter and salt to a medium sized bowl. Mix the butter on high speed with an electric mixer until it is pale in color and fluffy, about 5-10 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Then sift in the black cocoa powder. Mix until combined. Then sift in the powdered sugar a little at a time until it is all combined. The frosting will be thick at this point. Add in the heavy cream and mix until the frosting is light and fluffy, about 1-2 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Once the cupcakes are cool, add the black cocoa buttercream to a large piping bag fitted with a decorative star tip. (I love Wilton's 1M tip.) Pipe a generous amount of frosting onto the tops of each cupcake and add a few sprinkles if you wish. Then serve!</li>

                <li>4 large egg whites</li>
                <li>300g granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tbsp ground earl gray tea leaves</li>

                <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 225&deg;F</li>
                    <li>Start slowly whisking your egg whites and cream of tartar in an electric mixer to begin to form small air bubbles. This helps stabilise the meringue structure.</li>
                    <li>Once the egg whites are foamy, add the sugar a tablespoon at a time, whisking on high speed until the sugar is dissolved and the meringue is glossy and stiff.</li>
                    <li>Grind up your tea leaves in a pestle and mortar (although most leaves from teabags are finely ground enough) and fold with a spatula into the meringue mixture until combined.</li>
                    <li>Line a baking tray with parchment paper</li>
                    <li>Put the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a Wilton #12 tip.</li>
                    <li>Pipe legs by holding the tip perpendicular to the baking sheet. Gently squeeze a small circle for the center base of the octopus. In a similar manner, pipe 8 circles around the center one. Pipe the head on top of the center base of the meringue, making sure to swirl the tip to ensure a smooth sphere of meringue.</li>
                    <li>Place the trays into the oven and bake until they can be gently lifted off the paper. This usually takes 40 minutes to 1 hour depending on your oven.</li>
                    <li>If you like a marshmallow-y center, turn off the oven and leave meringues to cool for 15 minutes. If you like your meringues completely set, leave to cool in the oven for an hour. Once cooled to your desired textur, remove from oven and store in an airtight container for up to 3 weeks.</li>

            <h3>Directions</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Prepare an 8-inch square baking pan by lining it with parchment paper. Using a sieve, generously dust with corn starch* or powdered sugar.</li>
                    <li>In your stand mixer, pour the ½ c cold water, then sprinkle your gelatin on top. Set aside to let the gelatin soak up the liquid.</li>
                    <li>Bloom your ube powder by mixing it with your boiling water. Whisk and set aside.</li>
                    <li>In saucepan, add ½ c water and all of the sugar. Turn heat to medium and let it cook for a few minutes with the lid on until the sugar fully dissolves.</li>
                    <li>When the mixture starts boiling, check temperature using candy thermometer. Once it reaches about 240&deg;F, remove sugar water mixture from heat.</li>
                    <li>Turn on hand/stand mixer to medium speed and whip the thickened gelatin and bloomed ube mixture while slowly adding all of the hot sugar water mixture. Make sure to pour the mixture down the side of the bowl, so it cools as to not denature the gelatin</li>
                    <li>Whip for about 10 minutes, or until the mixture is thick, glossy, doubled in size, and reaches soft peaks.</li>
                    <li>Quickly, before the marshmallow begins to set, Add all of the marshmallow mixture into your prepared square pan. Level and smooth the top. Dust with more corn starch or powdered sugar and leave uncovered (6 hours room temp or 3 hours in the fridge) to allow the marshmallow block to fully set.</li>
                    <li>Remove marshmallow block from pan and use an oiled knife or pizza cutter to cut into cubes. Dip cut sides into powdered sugar to prevent them from sticking. Store in an airtight container for up to 1 month.</li>

                <li>Sift powdered sugar and almond flour using a whisk to break down any clumps. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Line sheet pans with silicone mats and place the templates under the mats.</li>
                <li>Insert the Wilton #12 baking tip into a pastry bag.</li>
                <li>Whisk the egg whites and cream of tartar on medium speed until you see small bubbles</li>
                <li>Slowly add 3 tbsp of granulated sugar, 1 tbsp at a time, waiting about 10 seconds between each tbsp.</li>
                <li>Whisk until you start to see tracks in the meringue.</li>
                <li>Increase speed to 6 and continue slowly adding the remainder of the granulated sugar, 1 tbsp at a time, until you’ve added all the sugar.</li>
                <li>Once you have soft peaks, stop the mixer, scrape the sides and add the vanilla extract.</li>
                <li>Whisk for about 5 more minutes, or until you have stiff peaks.</li>
                <li>Add in the powdered sugar and almond flour mixture in three parts, 1/3 at a time, folding each part until fully combined. Once the meringue and dry ingredients are fully combined, stop folding.</li>
                <li>Now you need to deflate some of the air in the batter by taking the spatula and smearing the batter on the sides of the bowl two or three times, and then folding once or twice. Repeat the process of smearing some of the batter on the side of the bowl and folding until the batter looks smooth and glossy and runs down the spatula slowly in ribbons.</li>
                <li>You can test the consistency by lifting the spatula and letting the batter run down. If it falls in ribbons and sinks back into itself within 30 seconds, the batter is ready.</li>
                <li>Take the pastry bag and, holding the bag at a 90° angle, pipe the body of the snowman. Pipe the heads once all the bodies are done, so as to prevent the two circles from mixing.</li>
                <li>Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick.</li>
                <li>Let the macarons rest until they form a skin and are no longer sticky. You should be able to drag your finger along the surface without denting or smudging the batter</li>
                <li>While the macarons are resting, preheat the oven to 300&deg;F.</li>
                <li>Bake the macarons for 14-15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Let the macaron shells cool for at least 30 minutes before decorating.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Cranberry Orange Curd</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Pour orange juice into a measuring cup and add enough water to make 3/4 cup liquid. Pour into a medium saucepan.</li>
                <li>Add orange zest, cranberries, and sugar and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, until cranberries have burst, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour cranberry mixture into a food processor or blender; blend until smooth, 10 to 20 seconds. Reserve 1/3 cup and return remaining cranberry mixture to saucepan over low heat.</li>
                <li>Whisk egg yolks together in a small bowl. Slowly add reserved cranberry mixture, whisking constantly. Slowly whisk egg-cranberry mixture back into the saucepan and continue whisking for 5 minutes, or until mixture is thickened and the curd coats the back of a metal spoon. Add butter and whisk until melted and fully incorporated.</li>
                <li>Pour curd into a sterile 1-pint jar and allow to cool; seal and store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Cardamom Buttercream</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Cream butter until fluffy and very pale in color.</li>
                <li>Add vanilla bean paste and cardamom and mix until combined.</li>
                <li>Continue beating while adding in sugar one cup at a time alternating with a splash of milk, beating until smooth in between each addition. Your buttercream is done when it is pale, fluffy, and holds its shape.</li>
            </ol>
