            <p>I went to The Netherlands in August of 2023 to visit my friend of over a decade. She lives in a city called Alphen an den Rijn &#40;a name which I could not pronounce at the time, and a Dutch customs officer laughed at me for it&#41;. I visited most of the major cities in the country during my stay, but I have to say my favorite was Leiden &#40;fun fact: in Dutch, it is common to omit the 'n' sound at the end of words when they are preceeded by a vowel. So, you usually hear it pronounced "lie-duh" rather than "Lie-den"&#41;. It is the country's oldest city, and one of the oldest established in Europe. It's university is beautiful, and the cobblestone streets are rather charming.</p>

            <p>I lived in Minnesota for four years while I was getting my undergraduate degree at Macalester College in St. Paul. Many of my friends still live in the area after falling in love with the Twin Cities. So, when Aloe had a CSCW conference in Minneapolis, of course I had to tag along. We had a wonderful time as I showed her around my old stomping grounds.</p>
